# Markdown Helper
This project enables working with markdown files using a command line interface. More specifically, it allows for modifying and searching for files using [Markdown Frontmatter](https://frontmatter.codes/docs/markdown).

This project came about because of incredibly useful Markdown note systems like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) which lack the ability to do things like move files based on tags or consolidate tags in a reliable way.

The project is still underway, and will be released in the future.
